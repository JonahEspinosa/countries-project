# Countries-App

*I made an app that allows you to look up any country you want and it gives you information about that country. Somethings it gives you is information like capital name, population, common languages, currencies, and even what continent its from. These past lessons we went over the Dom and how to use json. Those were a key to making this possible. We also went over some algorithms and how important they are also I dove in to some leetcode questions to see what they are like and its different when I finish the course im going to study a lot of it. I also want to get into doing Hackathons and see what those are like ive seen videos here and there about it but never got into it.

fetch(finalURL).then((response) => response.json()).then((data) => {result.innerHTML = `

This snippet of code is not the complete portion cause its a a lot of innerHTML. I have my github link at the bottom.

**searchBtn.addEventListener("submit",async(event)=> {
event.preventDefault()
let countryName = countryInp.value;

allbtn.addEventListener("click",()=>{
countries.forEach(country => {
let p = document.createElement("p")
p.innerText = country.name
countriesContainer.append(p)

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){**
(I have this wrapped around all my code)

Those are the 3 addeventListeners I'm using in my app.
